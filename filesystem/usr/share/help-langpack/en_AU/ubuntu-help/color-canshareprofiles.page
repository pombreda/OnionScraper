  <title>Can I share my colour profile?</title>

  <p>Colour profiles that you have created yourself are specific to the hardware and lighting conditions that you calibrated for. A display that has been powered for a few hundred hours is going to have a very different colour profile to a similar display with the next serial number that has been lit for a thousand hours.</p>
  <p>This means if you share your colour profile with somebody, you might be getting them <em>closer</em> to calibration, but it's misleading at best to say that their display is calibrated.</p>
  <p>Similarly, unless everyone has recommended controlled lighting (no sunlight from windows, black walls, daylight bulbs etc.) in a room where viewing and editing images takes place, sharing a profile that you created in your own specific lighting conditions doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>

  <note style="warning">
    <p>You should carefully check the redistribution conditions for profiles downloaded from vendor websites or that were created on your behalf.</p>
