  <title>How do I calibrate my screen?</title>

  <p>Calibrating your screen should be a requirement if you're involved in computer design or artwork.</p>

<if:when test="platform:unity">
  <p>By using a device called a colorimeter you can accurately measure the different colours that your screen is able to display. Run <guiseq><gui>System Settings</gui><gui>Device Colour Profiles</gui></guiseq> to create a profile, and the wizard will show you how to attach the colorimeter device and what settings to adjust.</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>Screens change all the time - the backlight in a TFT will halve in brightness approximately every 18 months, and will get yellower as it gets older. This means you should recalibrate your screen when the [!] icon appears in the colour control panel.</p>
    <p>LED screens also change over time, but a much slower rate than TFTs.</p>
