Installation instructions
=========================

The PHP scripts in this directory are used by the GDA Web provider and
have to be installed on a web server. The location of the scripts will have
to be passed as the PATH argument on the Libgda side when
opening the connection. For example if the scripts are accessible
as: http://example.com/path/to/gda-worker.php then the PATH argument
will have to be "path/to".

These scripts need the PHP engine's SimpleXML extension (which is
usually included when compiling PHP) and the PEAR's MDB2 module
(it's the module which actually opens the connection to the database)
for which the current implementation is provided under the PEAR_MDB2/
directory.

Once the scripts are installed, some configuration needs to be done
in the gda-config.php and gda-secure-config.php files:
- the gda-config.php defines where the PEAR MDB2 extension should be
  available, and where the gda-secure-config.php can be found.
- the gda-secure-config.php defines the actual connection(s) available
  through the Web interface. For security reasons this file should be moved
  to a location outside the Web server's PHP scripts (such as /etc)

Web server setup
----------------
You need a functionnal web server (tested with Apache and Lighthttpd but should
work fine with others) whih can interpret PHP scripts.

For example using Apache, you can either use an existing virtual host or create a
one. In any case all the PHP scripts (except the gda-secure-config.php) should be
copied in a single directory (this directory, relative to the DOCUMENT ROOT directory
should then specified as the PATH argument in a Libgda's connection string).

Connections setup
-----------------
Edit the gda-config.php file to:
- define where the PEAR MDB2 extension is located
- define where the gda-secure-config.php file is located

Move the gda-secure-config.php to a directory outside the DOCUMENT ROOT directory and
edit it to define connections available through the Web proxy.

Setup testing
-------------
The gda-tester.php script can be executed to diagnose any setup problem,
it reports errors if the MDB2 PEAR of SimpleXML extensions are missing,
and, for each configured connection, tests if it can be opened.

To use this scrip, simply point your favorite web browser to the URL:
http://<your server>/path/to/script/gda-tester.php


By default the gda-tester.php will _not_ test configured connection,
this needs to be enabled in the
script's source. Better yet is to remove that file once not necessary
anymore as it could leak useful information.
