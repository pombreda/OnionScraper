In the context menu of the icon blueman-applet provides in the notification area
you'll find all possibilities to setup and use your bluetooth devices. Simple
pairing without the applet can also be achieved by directly invoking
blueman-manager.

Please note that the NetworkManager plugins do not work with current versions of
NetworkManager!
