X-COMMENT:
 This package was debianized by Osamu Aoki <osamu@debian.org> on Wed, 23
 Jun 2010 00:18:56 +0900
 .
 This package is Debian specific package.
 .
 After maintaining im-switch (Version 1.5-1.20), Osamu Aoki realized it
 is too complicated for the simple task it does and decided to rewrite a
 new package with the same functionality via much simpler structure as
 im-switch.
 .
 The package description of the im-config is based on the one by Kenshi
 Muto <kmuto@debian.org> for im-config with some modifications by Osamu
 Aoki.
 .
 The Fredesktop.org menu data was originally created by Osamu Aoki for
 im-config and its translation data were added by the effort of Andrew
 Lee <ajqlee@debian.org>.
 .
 Osamu Aoki thanks the original authors of im-switch for giving him
 inspirations and reference data to write this im-config.
