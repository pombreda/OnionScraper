*** To do in the short term:

- PXELINUX: Figure out localboot/idle problems.

- PXELINUX: Support changing the default server and boot file prefix?

- Support loading a new configuration file.

- Library support for "shuffle and boot" extension.

- Library support for all the comboot system calls.

- Deal with non-512-byte sectors (if I can get media which does...)

- Add support for getting the hardware address on Infinibad.


*** Future projects:

- Clean up the command-line parsing.

- Cleaned up documentation, with a real man page.

- Support files that span multiple input media (SYSLINUX)
  -> Seems to be getting less important; floppies are dying?

- Clean up the handling of sections.

- API call to get directory listing.

- COM32-based CLI.

- Rewrite the filesystems to run in protected mode C code.
